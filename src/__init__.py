fast_db_models
==================

Shared SQLAlchemy ORM models intended to be reused across multiple apps.

The canonical declarative `Base` is exposed here for convenience:
`from fast_db_models import Base`.

Mixins, soft-delete, optimistic locking, and soft-delete helpers::

    from fast_db_models import Base, TimestampMixin, SoftDeleteMixin, OrganizationScopedMixin
    from fast_db_models.soft_delete import select_active, mark_soft_deleted
