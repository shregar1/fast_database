"""
Helpers for querying and mutating soft-deleted rows.

Expects models using :class:`fast_database.core.mixins.SoftDeleteMixin` or any
model with an ``is_deleted`` boolean column (and optionally ``deleted_at``).

Usage:
    from fast_database.core.mixins import SoftDeleteMixin
    from fast_database.core.soft_delete import (
        where_not_deleted,
        select_active,
        mark_soft_deleted,
        restore_soft_deleted,
        SoftDeleteRepositoryMixin,
    )
    
    class Item(SoftDeleteMixin, Base):
        __tablename__ = "items"
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = Column(String)
    
    # Create
    item = Item(name="Test")
    db.add(item)
    db.commit()
    
    # Soft delete (sets deleted_at and is_deleted)
    item.delete()
    db.commit()
    
    # Query excludes deleted by default
    stmt = select_active(Item)
    items = session.execute(stmt).scalars().all()  # Deleted items excluded
    
    # Include deleted
    all_items = session.execute(
        select(Item)
    ).scalars().all()
    
    # Restore
    item.restore()
    db.commit()
